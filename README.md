This repository includes a Data Package with the tabular data included in the publication:

> Daniel Alcalá-López, Jonathan Smallwood, Elizabeth Jefferies, Frank Van Overwalle, Kai Vogeley, Rogier B Mars, Bruce I Turetsky, Angela R Laird, Peter T Fox, Simon B Eickhoff, Danilo Bzdok, Computing the Social Brain Connectome Across Systems and States, *Cerebral Cortex*, Volume 28, Issue 7, July 2018, Pages 2207–2232, [https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx121](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx121)

A Data Package is a simple container format used to describe and package a collection of data. Data Packages are one of the Frictionless Data tools, an open-source toolkit created by the [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io), an [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org) project. It brings simplicity and gracefulness to the open data experience. For more information, see the [documentation](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-package/).

Neuroimaging files in compressed NIfTI format (.nii.gz) are available in the [ANIMA open database](https://anima.inm7.de/studies/AlcalaLopez_Social_Connectome_2017).

## Contents

 - Resource #1 ([ASJ+18-Table1a.csv](https://github.com/danalclop/Alcala-Lopez18CerebCortex/blob/main/data/ASJ%2B18-Table1a.csv)) corresponds to a part of the ```Table 1``` reported by Alcalá-López et al. (2018). It includes the list of meta-analyses used in the study, their bibliographic reference, the number of studies,	subjects, activation foci reported by those meta-analyses, and the neuroimaging technique used.

 - Resource #2 ([ASJ+18-Table1b.csv](https://github.com/danalclop/Alcala-Lopez18CerebCortex/blob/main/data/ASJ%2B18-Table1b.csv)) corresponds to the remaining part of the ```Table 1``` reported by Alcalá-López et al. (2018). It includes the list of cognitive processes investigated in the meta-analyses used in the study.

 - Resource #3 ([ASJ+18-Table2a.csv](https://github.com/danalclop/Alcala-Lopez18CerebCortex/blob/main/data/ASJ%2B18-Table2a.csv)) corresponds to a part of the of the ```Table 2``` reported by Alcalá-López et al. (2018). It includes the labels, coordinates, and macroanatomical description of the brain regions used in the study as seeds for the meta-analytic connectivity modeling and the resting-state functional connectivity analyses. It also includes the corresponding color codes (Hex code) used in the figures to display each seed.

 - Resource #4 ([ASJ+18-Table2b.csv](https://github.com/danalclop/Alcala-Lopez18CerebCortex/blob/main/data/ASJ%2B18-Table2b.csv) corresponds to the remaining part of the ```Table 2``` reported by Alcalá-López et al. (2018). It includes the microanatomical description of each seed as identified using the [JuBrain Anatomy Toolbox](https://github.com/inm7/jubrain-anatomy-toolbox), as well as their associated probability based on the combination of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps and functional imaging data.
